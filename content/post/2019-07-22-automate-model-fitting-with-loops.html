description: "The task of fitting many similar models can be automated by looping through variables.  I show an example of fitting the same model for multiple different response variables and then making residual plots for all models prior to extracting model results."

<p><em>This post was last updated on 2020-07-06.</em></p>
<p>When we have many similar models to fit, automating at least some portions of the task can be a real time saver. In <a href="https://aosmith.rbind.io/2019/06/24/function-for-model-fitting/">my last post</a> I demonstrated how to make a function for model fitting. Once you have made such a function itâ€™s possible to loop through variable names and fit a model for each one.</p>
<p>In this post I am specifically focusing on having many response variables with the same explanatory variables, using <code>purrr::map()</code> and friends for the looping. However, this same approach can be used for models with varying explanatory variables, etc.</p>

<p>The analysis in the example Iâ€™m using today amounts to a two-sample t-test. I will fit this as a linear model with <code>lm()</code>.</p>
<p>Since the response variable needs to vary among models but the dataset and explanatory variable do not, my function will have a single argument for setting the response variable.

<div id="looping-through-the-response-variables" class="section level1">
<h1>Looping through the response variables</h1>
<p>Iâ€™ll make a vector of the response variable names as strings so I can loop through them and fit a model for each one. I pull my response variable names out of the dataset with <code>names()</code>. This step may take more work for you if you have many response variables that arenâ€™t neatly listed all in a row like mine are. ðŸ˜œ</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vars = names(dat)[2:4]
vars</code></pre>
<pre><code># [1] &quot;resp&quot; &quot;slp&quot;  &quot;grad&quot;</code></pre>
<p>I want to keep track of which variable goes with which model. This can be accomplished by naming the vector Iâ€™m going to loop through. I name the vector of strings with itself using <code>purrr::set_names()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vars = set_names(vars)
vars</code></pre>
<pre><code>#   resp    slp   grad 
# &quot;resp&quot;  &quot;slp&quot; &quot;grad&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now Iâ€™m ready to loop through the variables and fit a model for each one with <code>purrr::map()</code>. Since my function takes a single argument, the response variable, I can list the function by name within <code>map()</code> without using a formula (<code>~</code>) or an anonymous function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>models = vars %&gt;%
     map(ttest_fun)</code></pre>
<p>The output is a list containing three models, one for each response variable. Notice that the output list is a <em>named</em> list, where the names of each list element is the response variable used in that model. This is the reason I took the time to name the response variable vector.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>models</code></pre>
<pre><code># $resp
# 
# Call:
# lm(formula = as.formula(form), data = dat)

<p>Note I could have done the <code>set_names()</code> step within the pipe chain rather than as a separate step.</p>

<div id="create-residual-plots-for-each-model" class="section level1">
<h1>Create residual plots for each model</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m working with a simple model fitting function, where the output only contains the fitted model. To extract other output I can loop through the list of models in a separate step. An alternative is to create all the output within the modeling function and then pull whatever you want out of the list of results.</p>
<p>In this case, my next step is to loop through the models and make residual plots. I want to look at a residuals vs fitted values plot as well as a plot to look at residual normality (like a boxplot, a histogram, or a quantile-quantile normal plot). In more complicated models I might also make plots of residuals vs explanatory variables.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll make a function to build the two residuals plots. My function takes a model and the model name as arguments. I extract residuals and fitted values via <code>broom::augment()</code> and make the two plots with <strong>ggplot2</strong> functions. I combine the plots via <strong>patchwork</strong>. I add a title to the combined plot with the name of the response variable from each model to help me keep track of things.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>resid_plots = function(model, modelname) {
     output = augment(model)
     
     res.v.fit = ggplot(output, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid) ) +
          geom_point() +
          theme_bw(base_size = 16)
     
     res.box = ggplot(output, aes(x = &quot;&quot;, y = .resid) ) +
          geom_boxplot() +
          theme_bw(base_size = 16) +
          labs(x = NULL)
     
     res.v.fit + res.box +
          plot_annotation(title = paste(&quot;Residuals plots for&quot;, modelname) )
}</code></pre>
<p>The output of this function is a combined plot of the residuals. Here is an example for one model (printed at 8" wide by 4" tall).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>resid_plots(model = models[[1]], modelname = names(models)[1])</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-22-automate-model-fitting-with-loops_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>I can use <code>purrr::imap()</code> to loop through all models and the model names simultaneously to make the plots with the title for each variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>residplots = imap(models, resid_plots)</code></pre>
<div id="examining-the-plots" class="section level2">
<h2>Examining the plots</h2>
<p>In a situation where I have many response variables, I like to save my plots out into a PDF so I can easily page through them outside of R. You can see some approaches for saving plots <a href="https://aosmith.rbind.io/2018/08/20/automating-exploratory-plots/#saving-the-plots">in a previous post</a>.</p>
<p>Since I have only a few plots I can print them in R. The last plot, shown below, looks potentially problematic. I see the variance increasing with the mean and right skew in the residuals.</p>

<div id="re-fitting-a-model" class="section level1">
<h1>Re-fitting a model</h1>
<p>If you find a problematic model fit youâ€™ll need to spend some time working with that variable to find a more appropriate model.</p>
<p>Once you have a model youâ€™re happy with, you can manually add the new model to the list (if needed). In my example, letâ€™s say the <code>grad</code> model needed a log transformation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gradmod = ttest_fun(&quot;log(grad)&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>If Iâ€™m happy with the fit of the new model I add it to the list with the other models to automate extracting results.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>models$log_grad = gradmod</code></pre>
<p>I remove the original model by setting it to <code>NULL</code>. I donâ€™t want any results from that model and if I leave it in I know Iâ€™ll ultimately get confused about which model is the final model. ðŸ˜•</p>
<pre class="r"><code>models$grad = NULL</code></pre>
<p>Now the output list has three models, with the new <code>log_grad</code> model and the old <code>grad</code> model removed.</p>

<div id="getting-model-results" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting model results</h1>
<p>Once you are happy with model fit of all models itâ€™s time to extract any output of interest. For a t-test we would commonly want the estimated difference between the two groups, which is in the <code>summary()</code> output. Iâ€™ll pull this information from the model as a data.frame with <code>broom::tidy()</code>. This returns the estimated coefficients, statistical tests, and (optionally) confidence intervals for coefficients</p>
<p>I switch to <code>map_dfr()</code> for looping to get the output combined into a single data.frame. I use the <code>.id</code> argument to add the response variable name to the output dataset.</p>
<p>Since some of the response variables are log transformed, it would make sense to back-transform coefficients in this step. I donâ€™t show this here, but would likely approach this using an <code>if()</code> statement based on log transformed variables containing <code>"log"</code> in their names.</p>

<p>The primary interest in this output would be in the <code>groupb</code> row for each variable. Since the output is a data frame (thanks <code>broom::tidy()</code>!) you can use standard data manipulation tools to pull out only rows and columns of interest.</p>
<p>Other output, like, e.g., AIC or estimated marginal means for more complicated models, can be extracted and saved in a similar way. Check out <code>broom::glance()</code> for extracting AIC and other overall model results.</p>
</div>
<div id="alternative-approach-to-fitting-many-models" class="section level1">
<h1>Alternative approach to fitting many models</h1>
<p>When I am working with many response variables with widely varying ranges, it feels most natural to me to keep the different variables in different columns and loop through them as I have shown above. However, a reasonable alternative is to <em>reshape</em> your dataset so all the values of all variables are in a single column. A second, categorical column will contain the variable names so we know which variable each row is associated with. Such reshaping is an example of making a <em>wide</em> dataset into a <em>long</em> dataset.</p>
<p>Once your data are in a long format, you can use a list-columns approach for the analysis. You can see an example of this in <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html#introduction-17">Chapter 25: Many models</a> of Grolemund and Wickhamâ€™s <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science book</a>.</p>
